***Columns that may not be needed: 
"date" (duplicated with the last two columns), "source".

***Columns that have been modified: 
The minimum and maximum yields ("yield_l", "yield_u") were used to calculate an average value (inserted next to the columns as "average_yield"), which is used  in the visualization. All missing yield values have been filled with 0.
The dates in the "date_long" colums have been converted to European format (DD/MM/YYYY). (inserted next to the column as "date_DMY")
Empty cells in the "name" and "purpose" columns were replaced with "*UNKNOWN".

Subdivision of the column"type":
"ATMOSPH": ATMOSPH,BALLOON,AIRDROP,ROCKET,TOWER,BARGE,WATERSUR,SURFACE,CRATER,UW,SHIP,SPACE,WATER SU
"UG":UG,SHAFT,TUNNEL,GALLERY,MINE,SHAFT/GR,SHAFT/LG

***general visualizzation:
in graphic--time, coordinates, yield, regions
in text--types, countries, purposes, names

***detail page:
mb, ms, depth(most values for these three parameters are 0), precise launch time("origin_t"), id, sourse
(personally i thinks they are meaningless)
